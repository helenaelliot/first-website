# first-website

I'm learning to code with The Odin Project. After learning about how the internet works, learning Git, and then HTML and CSS I did this website as my first project.

This project shows that I have learned how to use Git and GitHub. It also shows that I understand the basics of HTML, CSS and design:

- Good HTML structure, for readability and accessibility
- Use of HTML semantic elements
- Styling to produce a clean looking website
- Colors have sufficient contrast to pass WCAG criterias for accessibility
- Text uses rem as units, so text size can be changed by user in browser
- Use of CSS grid for wider screens, if the browser supports it
- Responsive website with media queries
- Responsive not only to width of screen, but also to CSS property (CSS grid)
- Fonts were chosen to accentuate each other
